# CutesyNoise
CutesyNoise is an Arduino UNO based sound installation comissioned by a small group of artists in Edmonton, AB in 2015.

It had two residencies; One at Latitude 54 Gallery for 6 weeks, and a second stint at the Edmonton Public Library for the NextFest 2015 festival.

CutesyNoise implements Morse Code short, long and pause patters to cycle 13 different motorized robotic insects on and off, creating a cicada cacaphony. Its rather quite lovely!

CutesyNoise lives in a box, waiting for its next performance.
